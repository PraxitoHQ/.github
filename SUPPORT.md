# How to Get Support

> This is an interim solution to provide support. We'll introduce a new way to provide support.

We offer support through the following channels:

1. **GitHub Issues**  
   For questions, bug reports, or feature requests related to our open-source products, please open an issue in the relevant repository on GitHub. Our team monitors issues regularly and will respond as soon as possible.

2. **Email Support**  
   Customers and users with other inquiries can contact us directly at [admin@praxito.com](mailto:admin@praxito.com). We aim to respond to all emails as soon as possible.
